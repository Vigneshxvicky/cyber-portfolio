🔍 Nmap Vulnerability Assessment Project

A hands-on vulnerability enumeration project analyzing exposed network services on a Linux machine using Nmap.
This assessment simulates real attacker reconnaissance and documents misconfigurations, service exposure, and potential attack paths.

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how network scanning and enumeration are performed in real environments using Nmap.
A Kali Linux target machine was configured with multiple services:

FTP (vsftpd)

SSH (OpenSSH)

HTTP (Apache2)

SMB (Samba)

The attacker machine used Nmap to detect open ports, identify service versions, analyze SMB security settings, and discover misconfigurations.

🧪 Tech Stack & Tools
Component	Details
Target System	Kali Linux
Attacker System	Kali Linux
Tools	Nmap 7.95, NSE Scripts
Services Enumerated	FTP, SSH, HTTP, SMB
Scans Performed	Full port scan, version detection, aggressive scan, vulnerability scan
🔥 Key Findings

Open Ports: 21, 22, 80, 139, 445

Service Identified:

FTP: vsftpd 3.0.5

SSH: OpenSSH 10.0p2

HTTP: Apache/2.4.65

SMB: Samba smbd 4

SMB Misconfiguration:

Message signing enabled but not required → can enable MITM or relay attacks

Version Disclosure:

Apache and SSH exposing version banners

Apache running default configuration (“It works” page)

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Network reconnaissance

Port scanning & enumeration

Vulnerability identification

SMB security understanding

Report writing (SOC & Pentesting style)

Hands-on Linux service configuration

Threat analysis & mitigation strategies

🛡 Security Recommendations

Require SMB signing to prevent relay attacks

Disable unnecessary services (FTP if not required)

Hide version disclosure on SSH and Apache

Use firewall to limit access to 21, 22, 80, 445

Enable SSH key-based authentication

Harden Apache configuration

📌 Next Steps

Expand enumeration with SMBclient & enum4linux

Add web application testing (DVWA)

Perform CVE mapping for identified services

Integrate results with a SIEM (Wazuh)
